- 👋 Hi
- 👀 I’m interested in gaining development experience to add to being an Agile PM, with the several-year goal of being a technical manager. I'm also interested in game design and community building; I enjoy designing and running tabletop and online RPGs. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end development (React/Bootstrap). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on React toolset or web development projects. 
- 📫 How to reach me: @ me in a repo :)
